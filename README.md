## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/marzann/loan_calc. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct, listed below.

This project is a starting point. I envision two separate options that can grow from it:

1) A library of different type of calculators, eg. standard, tax, tip, GPA, mortgage, etc. A user would simply choose from the app the type they wish to use, and perform calculations. A developer would be able to adapt part or entire library to their needs.

2) A financial information and services site, where users can obtain access to current rates, and useful resources.

Contributions to either option are welcome!
